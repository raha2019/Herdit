My wife is scaring me while she's asleep
So the last few nights have been pretty fucking creepy. It wasn't until thursday night that I really started to fear for my safety. You see, my wife (Jaime) has just recently started sleep waking/talking. The weird part is it doesn't sound like her. Her voice gets hoarse, and wheezy sounding, like she's smoked the past 30 years of her life. I'll start from the first night, it was Wednesday night I think.

It was 11:30pm, I remember because I was struggling to fall asleep, checking the clock every 5 minutes, counting down the hours I had to wake up and how much sleep I would get.

"You'd better stay in bed or else!" Jaime shouted, sending me jumping 2 feet in the air.

I stared at her with saucers for eyes, my heart hammering in my chest from being startled. After a minute or two of silence I couldn't help but to laugh at myself. I must've looked hilarious popping in the air like that.

"Don't you fucking laugh, I'll rip your spinal cord out and shove it down your throat!" Her voice sounding more raspy than before.

"Jesus Jaime, what in the hell are you dreaming about?" I said out loud, hoping she'd wake up.

She smiled this huge grin, bigger than I've ever seen a person smile before. I was officially getting a little creeped out.

"If you don't roll over and shut the fuck up, I'll make you swallow every tooth in your mouth." She said in the same raspy voice.

This was starting to get to be too much for me so I did as my sleeping wife demanded and rolled over, closing my eyes.

"Good boy..." Her voice sent shivers up my spine.

The rest of the night I couldn't fall back asleep. I listened to the occasional creepy laugh come from Jaime followed by heavy snores.

After a restless night I was pretty relieved to see the sun start to shine in through windows. I deemed it safe enough to get out of bed and head downstairs to put on a pot of coffee. Today was gonna be a long, tiring day at work. 

After a few minutes I heard the stairs creak as Jaime must've woke up. Sure enough she rounded the corner a few seconds later, yawning.

"Morning babe." She said sleepily.

"Morning." I replied.

I debated on whether to tell her about last night but in the end decided against it. I was tired and grumpy and honestly, she can talk too much sometimes and I was just too tired to listen to her yammer on.

After we drank our coffee we got ready for work to start our usual day. Work was horrible as I was struggling to stay awake all day. Of course it dragged on too, as I eagerly waited for four o'clock to come so I could go home and relax. After an eternity it was finally time to go home and I had completely forgotten about the previous night.

Jaime was already home as she only works five hours a day and gets out at one pm. She was cooking dinner thankfully, I was starving. After we ate dinner I was eager to get to bed, exhausted I didn't even get dressed in pajamas I just layed in bed and passed out. 

Sometime later in the night I woke up to hot air on my face. I struggled to open my tired eyes and when I finally I did I shrieked like a little girl. Jaime was like three inches from my face, panting heavily and her eyes were opened so wide she looked like a crazy woman.

"Jaime what the fuck?" I shouted as my heart pounded.

She said nothing, just stared.

"Jaime you need to wake up, you're scaring me!" I shouted.

She stopped panting and froze, glaring at me with those wild eyes. The her lips slowly started to part into the biggest fucking smile I had ever seen.

"Jaime knock it off!" I pleaded.

"Jaime knock it off!" She mimicked.

I was shocked when I heard her voice. It no longer sounded like jaime's at all. It was a deep, guttural growl. I stared at her in disbelief, no way I was dealing with just sleep talking here. There was something seriously wrong, like she was possessed.

"It's almost time, deeeeaaaarrr...." She grumbled.

Her laugh after she spone chilled me to the bone. I had never been so afraid in my life. Then after she finished laughing her body went limp and she was snoring heavily. I was left laying awake all night again, too afraid to go back to sleep. When morning finally did come I got up and called in sick.

"Hey babe what's wrong?" I didn't even notice Jaime come in the room.

"I'm not feeling so well today babe, I called in." I said with a yawn.

I hadn't decided to talked to her yet, if I did it would be when she got home this afternoon.

"Here lemme call in too babe, I can take care of you" she said with a warm smile.

"No!" I yelled before I cloud stop myself.

She looked at me with a puzzled look.

"I just wanna sleep babe, plus with me missing work today we could use the money." I lied.

"You sure?" She asked.

I nodded and thanked her for the offer. I planned on sleeping majority of the day but if she were home, I'd be too creeped out. I felt sad knowing I was afraid of my own wife. We'd been best friends and lovers for 13 years. Here I was now terrified of her...

After she left I plopped down on my recliner with some pizza rolls and dozed off as soon as I finished my unhealthy breakfast. I must've been exhausted because I awoke hours later to the sound of Jaime coming in.

"Hey how you feel?" She asked with a sympathetic look in her eyes.

"After getting some sleep I feel much better!" Which was completely true.

I also felt better because while eating my pizza rolls earlier I thought of a plan. I was going to tell Jaime I wasn't tired since I napped all day and was gonna stay down stairs and watch t.v. That way I could sleep without her creepy night time episodes, then talk to her the following day since we both had the day off.

After a while of relaxing and watched movies while eating dinner Jaime asked if I wanted to go to bed. I Told her I was gonna stay up a while and she gave me a kiss, then headed up to bed. My plan worked perfectly.

I sat awake for quite a while watching more t.v.
I must've dozed off because once again I woke up to noises, this time coming from the kitchen. I stayed as still as possible and listened closely. I heard what sounded like metal scraping against eithe each other.

"It's finally time! The big night is here!" Jaime talked to herself with that raspy voice I'd gotten used to hearing at night.

I was honestly terrified of what she was planning on doing so as quietly as possible I rolled off the side of the recliner and tip toed over to the kitchen to spy on what she was doing. My blood ran cold at what I saw. Jaime had a big kitchen knife and was scraping it on the knife sharpener. Her head kept snapping from side to side, making an awful cracking noise.

I turned around and quietly ran back to the living room, looking for a place to hide. I settled on the closet where we hung out coats. It's the kind that has slits in the doors, which would allow me to see if she was heading my away. That way I'd be prepared to defend myself if she attacked.

"Where are you boy?" She called from left, in the kitchen doorway.

My heart started pounding so loud I thought she'd hear it. She stormed through your living room searching for me. She screamed in frustration as she couldn't find me. Then she turned and thankfully headed up stairs. When I heard her get in the bedroom and start throwing things I quietly crept out of the closet and grabbed my phone and car keys. I ran to the door no longer caring if she heard me, I was getting the fuck out of there.

"Nnnooooo!" I heard her scream as I ran in the car. 

I started the car and backed out of the driveway as fast as I could. As I was leaving I looked at the house one last time and somehow she was already at the front door. She had to have been running impossibly fast to make it downstairs that fast. I turned my gaze back to the road and sped away.

After 10 minutes I pulled into a hotel and booked a room for 2 nights. I've been here for a few hours now trying to calm down. I just started getting missed calls and texts from Jaime, wondering where the hell I'm at. Im not ready to talk right now, even though I know I need to confront her about her scary and violent "sleep walking". I'll update after I talk to her figure out what to do next. Any help would be appreciated as what in the hell I'm dealing with here...
