PSA: Launcher Issue fix.
If you are having trouble starting/opening the Minecraft Launcher after its most recent update, please read the following.

If you are unable to start the Minecraft Launcher, right now there is no proper Fix for the issue. But I am seeing a few people that got a workaround working. Keep in mind this method is not the most recommended as it may interfere with the normal launcher once the issue is resolved, so make a backup of your .minecraft folder.

Then right click the launcher shortcut and select Properties. Go into the compatibility tab and turn on Compatibility Mode, set it to Windows Vista. Then hit Apply and OK. This will run a legacy launcher. Launch the game here once, then close the game and launcher (If you get stuck with a message that says "Prepairing" you can also just close it all out). Turn off compatibility mode, the current launcher should redownload itself and work.

So far this has worked for most of the users with the issue in the #minecrafthelp IRC channel. Let me know if you get any different results.

Side Note: If you are having an issue where the launcher gives you messages similar to either "Cannot update the runtime environment" or "Cannot update the native launcher", these are most often caused by other programs running on the computer introducing an incompatibility or preventing the game from downloading or installing the files it needs. Please check the info available [here](https://minecraftirc.net/support-articles/known-incompatible-software/) to make sure you do not have any incompatible software installed.

Also: as apparently this needs to be said now. If your computer has multiple storage devices installed, make sure you are installing the launcher to its default location which is on your OS drive.

**Update:** There was another launcher update released around October 21st. This may resolve the issue for users who still had issues after trying the workaround.
Minecraft Bi-Weekly Build Challenge #82: Vineyard

What an incredible build. 

I would normally never consider living in hell, not in game and definitely not in real life but this makes it a little more appealing. Loved the design of the houses and especially the location, above the lava. One thing that I noticed as well was the color of the houses. I never would have guessed someone would use end bricks and prismarine in a nether build, which are quite literally the opposite of the nether. Yet here we are and the end result was a great contrast between the bleak landscape and fantastic build!

Awesome job!

Really liked the landscaping done in this build. I'm not lying when I say that I had to look at the first images a couple times to make sure you weren't using a mod that tried to add the new nether things. Great building, especially only based off those images we got. I did like the base although I felt the entrance made from quartz and then into hardened clay felt slightly off but the build was still very well done!

Great job!

While I do love the idea of people living in the nether in nice bases, I also feel the nether is a perfect place to make ruined, destroyed bases as well. And this build did it perfectly. While this build wasn't mainly ruins and was livable, I was impressed how the entire build felt like it was going to collapse any minute. I won't talk much about the buildings, because they are well built however I do want to mention the landscape. Was really impressed with how well it flowed together. The different blocks incorporated into the ground broke it up enough that it didn't draw away from the main build yet it still looked good.

Good job!

#**Introduction**

It's fall, which is usually the time for harvest. This week, we won't be focusing on harvesting at all, but rather growing. And even then, we're more interested in the scenery and design on a vineyard, which usually feature beautiful hills and nice countrysides. 

So let's get to building! 


**New Textures**

Since we have an official release of the new textures, they are now allowed (along with the old ones). However, if you use the new textures, please specify. I wouldn't want to think you're using a texture pack and disqualify you. I'm not as used to the textures, so I may not recognize them right away.
